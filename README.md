# Company Bankruptcy Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict company bankruptcy using a dataset collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009. The dataset contains features relevant to company financial data, and bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

## Description
The dataset consists of financial features of companies, including operating profit rate, cash flow rate, net value per share, and others. The target variable indicates whether a company went bankrupt or not.

## Dataset Information
- Number of Features: 
- Target Variable: 'Bankrupt?'
- Preprocessing Steps: 
- Feature Description: [List feature descriptions here]

## Models and Results
The following models were evaluated for bankruptcy prediction:
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
